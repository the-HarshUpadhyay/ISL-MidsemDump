# Lab No.5: Hashing 

# Objectives 

1. To implement user defined hashing function. 

2. To demonstrate the application of hash function. 

# Introduction 

A hash function H takes an input data block M of variable length and generates a fixed-size hash value h=H(M). An effective hash function ensures that applying it to a large set of inputs yields outputs that are evenly distributed and seemingly random. The primary goal of a hash function is to maintain data integrity, such that any change in the input M, even by a single bit, will likely result in a different hash value. 

For security purposes, a special type of hash function, known as a cryptographic hash function, is used. This algorithm has two key properties: 

- The one-way property, which makes it computationally infeasible to find a data object that matches a pre-specified hash result. 

- The collision-free property, which makes it computationally infeasible to find two distinct data objects that produce the same hash result. 

Due to these properties, cryptographic hash functions are commonly employed to verify whether data has been altered.

Figure 5.1 Cryptographic Hash Function 

Figure 5.1 illustrates how a cryptographic hash function operates. Generally, the input data is padded to make its length an integer multiple of a specific fixed size (e.g., 1024 bits). This padding includes a field that represents the length of the original message in bits. The length field acts as a security measure, making it more challenging for an attacker to create a different message with the same hash value. [Ref: Cryptography and Network Security: Principles and Practice 7th Global Edition] 

Lab Exercises 

1. Implement the hash function in Python. Your function should start with an initial hash value of 5381 and for each character in the input string, multiply the current hash value by 33, add the ASCII value of the character, and use bitwise operations to ensure thorough mixing of the bits. Finally, ensure the hash value is kept within a 32-bit range by applying an appropriate mask. 

2. Using socket programming in Python, demonstrate the application of hash functions for ensuring data integrity during transmission over a network. Write server and client scripts where the server computes the hash of received data and sends it back to the client, which then verifies the integrity of the data by comparing the received hash with the locally computed hash. Show how the hash verification detects data corruption or tampering during transmission. 

3. Design a Python-based experiment to analyze the performance of MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 hashing techniques in terms of computation time and collision resistance. Generate a dataset of random strings ranging from 50 to 100 strings, compute the hash values using each hashing technique, and measure the time taken for hash computation. Implement collision detection algorithms to identify any collisions within the hashed dataset. 

# Additional Exercise 

1. Write server and client scripts where the client sends a message in multiple parts to the server, the server reassembles the message, computes the hash of the reassembled message, and sends this hash back to the client. The client then verifies the integrity of the message by comparing the received hash with the locally computed hash of the original message. 

# Lab No. 6: Digital Signature 

Objectives 

- Demonstrate the use of digital signatures 

- Demonstrate the verification of a digital signature 

# **Background** 

A digital signature is a mathematical technique used to validate the authenticity and integrity of a digital message. A digital signature is the equivalent of a handwritten signature. Digital signatures can actually be far more secure. The purpose of a digital signature is to prevent the tampering and impersonation in digital communications. 

# Using Digital Signatures 

In this part, you will use a website to verify a document signature between Alice and Bob. Alice and Bob share a pair of private and public RSA keys. Each of them uses their private key to sign a legal document. They then send the documents to each other. Both Alice and Bob can verify each other’s signature with the public key. They must also agree on a shared public exponent for calculation

Step 1: Sign the Document. 

Alice signs a legal document and send it to Bob using the RSA public and private keys shown in the table above. Now Bob will have to verify Alice’s digital signature in order to trust the authenticity of the electronic document. 

Step 2: Verify Digital Signature. 

Bob receives the document with a digital signature shown in the table below.
