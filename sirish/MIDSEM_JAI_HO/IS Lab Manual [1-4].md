# **Lab No. 1: Basic Symmetric Key Ciphers** 

# **Objectives** 

- To familiarize with Substitution Ciphers. 

- To understand the working of transposition ciphers. 

Symmetric key ciphers use the same key to encrypt and decrypt data. They are often used in combination with other algorithms into a symmetric encryption schemes. 

Symmetric key cryptography schemes are categorized as stream ciphers and block ciphers. Stream ciphers work on a single bit (byte or computer word) at a time and execute some form of feedback structure so that the key is repeatedly changing.

**Figure 1: Stream Cipher** 

# **Block Cipher** 

In a block cipher, a group of plaintext symbols of size _m_ ( _m_ > 1) are encrypted together creating a group of ciphertext of the same size. A single key is used to encrypt the whole block even if the key is made of multiple values as shown in Figure 2. 

7 

> _Database and Domain Name Servers_ ~~Ciphertext a~~ _<u>(DNS)</u>_ 

**Figure 2: Block Cipher** 

A block cipher is so-called because the scheme encrypts one block of information at a time utilizing the same key on each block. In general, the same plaintext block will continually encrypt to the same ciphertext when using the similar key in a block cipher whereas the same plaintext will encrypt to different ciphertext in a stream cipher. 

Block ciphers can operate in several modes such as Electronic Codebook (ECB), Cipher Block Chaining (CBC), Cipher Feedback (CFB) and Output Feedback (OFB) mode. 

# **Substitution Ciphers** 

A substitution cipher replaces one symbol with another. Substitution ciphers can be categorized as either monoalphabetic ciphers or polyalphabetic ciphers 

In monoalphabetic substitution, the relationship between a symbol in the plaintext to a symbol in the ciphertext is always one-to-one. The simplest monoalphabetic cipher is the additive cipher, shown in Figure 3. This cipher is sometimes called a shift cipher and sometimes a Caesar cipher. 

**When the cipher is additive, the plaintext, ciphertext, and key are integers in Z26.** 

**In a multiplicative cipher, the plaintext and ciphertext are integers in Z26; the key is an integer in Z26*.**

# **Figure 3. Additive Cipher** 

In polyalphabetic substitution, each occurrence of a character may have a different substitute. The relationship between a character in the plaintext to a character in the ciphertext is one-

# **Lab No. 2: Advanced Symmetric Key Ciphers** 

# **Objectives** 

- To understand the working of DES and AES algorithms. 

- To implement AES and DES algorithm. 

- Analyze the performance of AES and DES algorithms 

# **_DES:_** 

**_The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric-key block cipher published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)_** 

**_The encryption process is made of two permutations (P-boxes, initial and final permutations, and sixteen Feistel rounds as shown in Figure 4_**

# **Figure 4: General structure of DES** 

**Initial Permutation (IP)** : The 64-bit plaintext block is permuted according to a fixed table, shuffling the bits to create a new order. 

**Key Schedule Generation** : The 56-bit key is divided into two 28-bit halves. Each half is then rotated and permuted according to a predefined schedule to produce sixteen 48-bit round keys, one for each round of encryption. 

**16 Rounds of Encryption** : The 64-bit block is split into two 32-bit halves, called Left (L) and Right (R).

**Figure 5: Single** 

**Round of DES Algorithm** 

Single round of DES is shown in Figure 5. For each of the 16 rounds, a new right half is generated by expanding the previous right half to 48 bits using the Expansion (E) function. 

13 

_Database and Domain Name Servers (DNS)_ 

The expanded right half is XORed with the round key. That result is passed through a series of substitution boxes (S-boxes), which reduce the 48-bit output back to 32 bits. The S-box output is then permuted using the Permutation (P) function. The new right half is XORed with the previous left half. The previous right half becomes the new left half. 

- After 16 rounds, the left and right halves are recombined and permuted using the final permutation (FP). 

**Final Permutation (FP)** : The combined left and right halves are permuted according to a fixed table to produce the final 64-bit ciphertext block. 

# **The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES):** 

AES is a symmetric-key block cipher published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in December 2001. AES is a non-Feistel cipher that encrypts and decrypts a data block of 128 bits. It uses 10, 12, or 14 rounds. The key size, which can be 128, 192, or 256 bits, depends on the number of rounds. 

Main components of AES are as follows as shown in Figure 6. 

**Initial Round** : **AddRoundKey** : Each byte of the state is combined with a round key using the XOR operation. 

**Main Rounds** (Repeated for 9, 11, or 13 times depending on key size): 

**SubBytes** : A non-linear substitution step where each byte is replaced with another byte using an S-box (substitution box). 

**ShiftRows** : A transposition step where each row of the state is shifted cyclically by a certain 

14 

_Database and Domain Name Servers (DNS)_ 

number of bytes. 

**MixColumns** : A mixing operation which operates on the columns of the state, combining the four bytes in each column. 

**AddRoundKey** : Each byte of the state is combined with a round key using the XOR operation. 

**Final Round** : It has SubBytes, ShiftRows and AddRoundKey steps

Figure 7: Structure of each round at the encryption site 

To provide security, AES uses four types of transformations: substitution, permutation, mixing, and key-adding. 

Detailed description about each type of transformation is as follows: 

# **Substitution** 

The first transformation, SubBytes, is used at the encryption site. To substitute a byte, we interpret the byte as two hexadecimal digits. 

**Transformation Using the GF(2**<sup>**8**</sup> **) Field** 

AES also defines the transformation algebraically using the GF(28) field with the irreducible polynomials (x<sup>8</sup> + x<sup>4</sup> + x<sup>3</sup> + x + 1) 

The SubBytes and InvSubBytes transformations are inverses of each other. 

16 

_Database and Domain Name Servers (DNS)_ 

Another transformation found in a round is shifting, which permutes the bytes as shown in Figure 8. In the encryption, the transformation is called ShiftRows.

**_Figure 8: ShiftRows transformation_** 

# **InvShiftRows** 

In the decryption, the transformation is called InvShiftRows and the shifting is to the right. 

# **MixColumns** 

The MixColumns transformation operates at the column level; it transforms each column of the state to a new column. The MixColumns and InvMixColumns transformations are inverses of each other. 

# **Key Adding** 

AddRoundKey proceeds one column at a time. AddRoundKey adds a round key word with each state column matrix; the operation in AddRoundKey is matrix addition.

# **Lab No. 3: Asymmetric Key Ciphers** 

# **Objectives** 

- To demonstrate the ability to generate, use, and understand the public and private keys in various asymmetric encryption schemes. 

- To understand the performance implications of different asymmetric encryption algorithms 

Asymmetric algorithms rely on one key for encryption and a different but related key for decryption. These algorithms have the following important characteristics: 

- It is computationally infeasible to determine the decryption key given only knowledge of cryptographic algorithms and encryption keys. 

- Either of the two related keys can be used for encryption, with the other used for decryption

# **THE RSA ALGORITHM** 

The RSA scheme is a cipher in which the plaintext and ciphertext are integers between 0 and n - 1 for some n. A typical size for n is 1024 bits, or 309 decimal digits. That is, n is less than 21024. We examine RSA in this section in some detail, beginning with an explanation of the algorithm. Then we examine some of the computational and cryptanalytical implications of 

21 

_Database and Domain Name Servers (DNS)_ 

RSA. RSA uses the mathematical properties of prime numbers and modular arithmetic. 

- Public keys are used for encryption, and private keys are used for decryption. 

- The security of RSA relies on the difficulty of factoring large composite numbers into their prime factors. 

RSA is widely used for secure data transmission, digital signatures, and key exchange mechanisms due to its robustness and security features 

# **Key Generation** 

- Generate Two Large Prime Numbers: Choose two distinct large prime numbers, p and q. These primes should be large enough to ensure the security of the RSA algorithm. 

- Compute the Modulus: 

Calculate n=p×q; n is used as the modulus for both the public and private keys. 

- Compute Euler's Totient Function: Calculate (n)=(p−1)×(q−1).ϕ 

ϕ(n) represents the number of integers less than n that are relatively prime to n. 

- Choose the Public Exponent: Select an integer ee such that 1<e<ϕ(n) and gcd(e,ϕ(n))=1. 

The public exponent e is typically chosen as a small prime number like 3 or 65537 for efficiency. 

- Compute the Private Exponent: Calculate the private exponent d such that d×e≡1(modϕ(n)). 

22 

_Database and Domain Name Servers (DNS)_ 

d is the modular multiplicative inverse of ee modulo (n).ϕ 

- Public and Private Keys: The public key consists of (n,e). The private key consists of (n,d). 

# **Encryption** 

- Convert the Message: Convert the plaintext message M into an integer m such that 0≤m<n. 

- This can be done using a suitable padding scheme to ensure the message is within the valid range. 

- Encrypt the Message: Compute the ciphertext cc using the public key: c=m<sup>e</sup> mod n 

# **Decryption** 

- Decrypt the Ciphertext: Compute the plaintext message m using the private key: m=c<sup>d</sup> mod n 

- Convert the Integer Back to Message: Convert the integer m back to the original plaintext message M. 

# **ELGAMAL Encryption Algorithm** 

The ElGamal encryption algorithm is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm based on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. It was designed by Taher ElGamal in 1985 and provides both encryption and digital signature functionalities. 

23

- Compute the ciphertext components: 

`o` _c1=g_<sup>_k_</sup> _mod p_ 

`o` _c2=m_ ⋅ _y_<sup>_k_</sup> _mod p_ 

**Ciphertext:** (c1 ,c2 ) 

# **Decryption** 

Use the private key _xx_ x to compute: 

- _s=c1xmod p_ 

Compute the plaintext message m as: 

- _m=c2_ ⋅ _s_<sup>_−1_</sup> _mod p_ 

- Here, s<sup>−1</sup> is the modular inverse of _s_ modulo p. 

**Plaintext:** M

_Database and Domain Name Servers (DNS)_ 

# **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)** 

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is an asymmetric encryption technique based on the algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields. It offers significant advantages over traditional RSA encryption, such as smaller key sizes for equivalent security levels and faster computational speeds. 

# **Key Components** 

# **Elliptic Curve Definition:** 

An elliptic curve over a finite field Fp is defined by an equation of the form y<sup>2</sup> =x<sup>3</sup> +ax+b mod p, where a and b are constants defining the curve's shape, and p is a prime number. 

# **Base Point G (Generator):** 

`o` A specific point on the curve used as the base for generating keys and performing operations. 

# **Private Key d:** 

- A random integer d chosen as the private key. 

# **Public Key Q:** 

- The public key is computed as Q=d⋅G, where .(dot) denotes elliptic curve point multiplication. 

# **Key Generation** 

26 

_Database and Domain Name Servers (DNS)_ 

# **Curve Parameters:** 

27 

_Database and Domain Name Servers (DNS)_ 

- Choose a suitable elliptic curve (e.g., secp256k1) defined over a finite field Fp . 

- Select curve parameters a, b, and a prime modulus p. 

# **Base Point G Selection:** 

- Choose a base point G on the elliptic curve. 

# **Private Key Generation:** 

- Generate a random integer _d_ such that 1≤d<order of G. 

# **Public Key Computation:** 

- Compute the public key Q as Q=d⋅G. 

**Public key:** Q 

**Private key:** _d_ 

# **Encryption and Decryption** 

ECC is primarily used for key exchange rather than direct encryption of messages. The Diffie-Hellman key exchange and elliptic curve DSA (ECDSA) are commonly used protocols based on ECC for secure communication and digital signatures 

28

4. Design and implement a secure file transfer system using RSA (2048-bit) and ECC (secp256r1 curve) public key algorithms. Generate and exchange keys, then encrypt and decrypt files of varying sizes (e.g., 1 MB, 10 MB) using both algorithms. Measure and compare the performance in terms of key generation time, encryption/decryption speed, and computational overhead. Evaluate the security and efficiency of each algorithm in the context of file transfer, considering factors such as key size, storage requirements, and resistance to known attacks. Document your findings, including performance metrics and a summary of the strengths and weaknesses of RSA and ECC for secure file transfer. 

5. As part of a project to enhance the security of communication in a peer-to-peer file sharing system, you are tasked with implementing a secure key exchange mechanism using the Diffie-Hellman algorithm.

Measure the time taken for key generation, encryption, and decryption processes for messages of various sizes (e.g., 1 KB, 10 KB). Compare the computational efficiency and overhead of RSA and ElGamal algorithms. Perform the same for ECC with RSA and ElGamal.

# **Lab No. 4: Advanced Asymmetric Key Ciphers** 

# **Objectives :** 

- Implement and compare the performance of multiple asymmetric encryption algorithms (e.g., RSA, ElGamal, Rabin) in a controlled environment, measuring factors such as encryption/decryption speed and key generation time. 

- Design and develop a modular key management system capable of handling various cryptographic protocols, with emphasis on scalability, security, and ease of integration. 

- Create a flexible framework for testing different access control mechanisms in cryptographic systems, allowing for easy implementation and evaluation of various policies and revocation strategies 

**Asymmetric Encryption Algorithms:** Asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key cryptography, uses a pair of mathematically related keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. This approach allows secure communication without the need to share secret keys. Common asymmetric algorithms include RSA, ElGamal, and Rabin. Each has its own mathematical foundations and security properties, making comparative analysis valuable for understanding their strengths and weaknesses in different scenarios. 

**Key Management Systems:** Key management is a critical aspect of cryptographic systems, encompassing the generation, exchange, storage, use, and replacement of cryptographic keys. A robust key management system ensures the security and integrity of encrypted communications. It must handle tasks such as key generation, distribution, storage, rotation, and revocation. The challenges in key management increase with the scale and complexity of 

31 

_Database and Domain Name Servers (DNS)_ 

the system, especially in distributed environments. 

**Access Control in Cryptographic Systems:** Access control in cryptography involves mechanisms to restrict access to encrypted data or cryptographic operations. This includes managing who can encrypt or decrypt data, as well as controlling access to keys. Implementing flexible access control policies is crucial for maintaining security in various scenarios, from simple user authentication to complex, attribute-based access control systems. The ability to revoke access and update policies dynamically is also an important consideration in modern cryptographic systems. 

# **Mathematical Foundations** 

# **RSA Algorithm:** 

1. Key Generation: 

   - Choose two large prime numbers p and q 

   - Compute n = p * q 

   - Compute φ(n) = (p-1) * (q-1) 

   - Choose e such that 1 < e < φ(n) and gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1 

   - Compute d such that d * e ≡ 1 (mod φ(n)) 

   - Public key: (n, e), Private key: (n, d) 

32 

_Database and Domain Name Servers (DNS)_ 

2. Encryption: 

For plaintext m, ciphertext c = m^e mod n 

3. Decryption: 

m = c^d mod n 

**ElGamal Algorithm:** 

1. Key Generation: 

   - Choose a large prime p and a generator g of the multiplicative group of integers modulo p 

   - Choose a random integer x, 1 < x < p-1 

   - Compute y = g^x mod p 

   - Public key: (p, g, y), Private key: x 

2. Encryption: 

   - Choose a random k, 1 < k < p-1 

   - Compute c1 = g^k mod p 

- Compute s = y^k mod p 

   - For plaintext m, compute c2 = m * s mod p 

33 

_Database and Domain Name Servers (DNS)_ 

- Ciphertext: (c1, c2) 

3. Decryption: 

   - Compute s = c1^x mod p 

   - Compute m = c2 * s^(-1) mod p 

# **Rabin Algorithm:** 

1. Key Generation: 

   - Choose two large primes p and q, where p ≡ q ≡ 3 (mod 4) 

   - Compute n = p * q 

   - Public key: n, Private key: (p, q) 

2. Encryption: 

For plaintext m, ciphertext c = m^2 mod n 

3. Decryption: 

   - Compute mp = c^((p+1)/4) mod p 

   - Compute mq = c^((q+1)/4) mod q 

   - Use Chinese Remainder Theorem to find four square roots: 

34 

_Database and Domain Name Servers (DNS)_ 

r1 = (yp * p * mq + yq * q * mp) mod n 

r2 = n - r1 

r3 = (yp * p * mq - yq * q * mp) mod n 

r4 = n - r3 

where yp * p + yq * q = 1 

- One of these roots is the original message m 

Each of these algorithms has its own unique mathematical properties that contribute to its security and performance characteristics. RSA relies on the difficulty of factoring large numbers, ElGamal is based on the discrete logarithm problem, and Rabin's security is tied to the difficulty of finding square roots modulo a composite number. 

# **Key Management Systems:** 

1. Key Entropy: 

Entropy H of a key K with n possible values, each with probability p(i): 

H(K) = -∑(i=1 to n) p(i) * log2(p(i)) 

2. Key Derivation Function 

(KDF): DK = KDF(Key, Salt, 

35 

_Database and Domain Name Servers (DNS)_ 

Iterations) 

36 

_Database and Domain Name Servers (DNS)_ 

Where DK is the derived key, Key is the original key or password, Salt is a random value, 

and Iterations is the number of times the function is applied. 

3. Key Rotation: 

For a system with N keys and a rotation period of T: 

Rotation Rate = N / T 

4. Key Expiry: 

If a key K is created at time t0 with lifetime L: 

Expiry Time = t0 + L 

5. Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange: 

Public parameters: prime p, generator g 

Alice computes: A = g^a mod p 

Bob computes: B = g^b mod p 

Shared secret: K = A^b mod p = B^a mod p = g^(ab) mod p

# **Access Control in Cryptographic Systems:** 

1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): 

Access(User, Object) = ∃Role : HasRole(User, Role) ∧ CanAccess(Role, Object) 

2. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC): 

= Access(User, Object, Environment) f(UserAttributes, ObjectAttributes, EnvironmentAttributes) 

Where f is a policy function evaluating to true or false. 

3. Bell-LaPadula Model: 

- Simple Security Property: S(Subject) ≥ C(Object) for read access 

- *-Property: S(Subject) ≤ C(Object) for write access 

Where S is the security level of the subject and C is the classification of the object. 

4. Mandatory Access Control (MAC): 

AccessGranted = (SubjectClearance ≥ ObjectClassification) ∧ PolicyRulesatisfied 

5. Discretionary Access Control (DAC): 

AccessMatrix[Subject, Object] = {Rights} 

38 

_Database and Domain Name Servers (DNS)_ 

Where Rights could be Read, Write, Execute, etc. 

# 6. Time-based Access Control: 

Access (User, Object, Time) = (Time ≥ StartTime) ∧ (Time ≤ EndTime) ∧ OtherConditions 

# 7. Probabilistic Access Control: 

P(Access Granted | Conditions) = f(UserTrustLevel, ObjectSensitivity, 

EnvironmentRisk) Where P is probability and f is a function mapping conditions to a 

probability. 

These equations and mathematical concepts form the basis for implementing and analyzing key management and access control systems. They allow for quantitative assessment of security properties, guide the design of secure systems, and provide a framework for evaluating the effectiveness of different approaches in cryptographic access control.

# **Question 2** 

Suppose that XYZ Logistics has decided to use the RSA cryptosystem to secure their sensitive communications. However, the security team at XYZ Logistics has discovered that one of their employees, Eve, has obtained a partial copy of the RSA private key and is attempting to recover the full private key to decrypt the company's communications. 

Eve's attack involves exploiting a vulnerability in the RSA key generation process, where the prime factors (p and q) used to generate the modulus (n) are not sufficiently large or random. 

Develop a Python script that can demonstrate the attack on the vulnerable RSA 

cryptosystem and discuss the steps to mitigate the attack.
